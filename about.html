      <h3>About</h3>
      <p><strong>Title 1: Description of the Website's Functionality - Converting Readable Sentences into Encrypted Secret Codes</strong></p>
      <p>This section provides an explanation of the website's functionality, which revolves around converting readable sentences into encrypted secret codes. Users can enter a sentence or a secret code in the input field, and by clicking the "Encrypt" button, the text is transformed into an encrypted form using the AES algorithm and a secret key. The encrypted code is then displayed in the result box. Conversely, if a user has an encrypted code, they can paste it into the input field and click the "Decrypt" button to convert it back into its readable form. This feature allows for secure communication between trusted parties who share the secret key.</p>
      <p><strong>Title 2: Nested Encryptions - Encrypting and Decrypting Messages Multiple Times for Added Security</strong></p>
      <p>In this section, the concept of nested encryptions is introduced. It involves an additional layer of security by encrypting an already encrypted secret code. Users can enter their readable sentence in the input field, which is initially converted into a secret code using encryption. Then, the resulting encrypted code is encrypted again, creating a nested encryption. The doubly encrypted code can be sent to another person. Upon receiving it, the recipient must first decrypt the entire secret code using the appropriate secret key. Subsequently, they can decrypt the second layer of encryption to reveal the original readable sentence. This process adds an extra level of protection to the message by requiring multiple decryption steps for the intended recipient to access the final answer.</p>
